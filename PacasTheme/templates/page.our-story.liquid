    <p>Noticing that socks provided to children staying at hospitals needed a serious upgrade, we set out to find the softest, most comfortable fiber the world has to offer.  Alpacas it was, and Pacas was born.</p>
    <p>Our <b>mission</b> is to bring the amazing performance characteristics of alpaca fiber to you at an affordable price, and in doing so outfit every child staying at a childrenâ€™s hospital with Pacas products to make their stay as comfy as possible.</p>
    
    <p>Each month, a percentage of our profits goes toward donating Pacas socks to local children's hospitals. This month we are donating to Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, IL, which has a special place in our hearts.</p>
